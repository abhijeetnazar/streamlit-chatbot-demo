Module 4 Selenium & Java Advance
This module will be very exciting. Here we will learn about Waits in Selenium. Waits are used to hold the web application for a few seconds/minutes/hours. When web applications navigate from Page A to Page B then Selenium should wait till the browser loads Page B completely. Along with waits, we will also learn to Handle multiple windows and Alerts.
